# Pizza Sales Data Analysis

### Overview

This project analyzes the sales data of a pizza shop to derive meaningful insights that can help in making data-driven decisions. The analysis covers various aspects of the sales performance, including total revenue, average order value, trends in pizza orders, and the performance of different pizza categories and sizes.

### Project Objectives

- To calculate key metrics such as total revenue, average order value, and total pizzas sold.
- To identify trends in pizza sales across different times of the day and week.
- To analyze the performance of different pizza categories and sizes.
- To determine the top and bottom performers in terms of revenue.

### Data Analysis

#### Total Revenue

The total revenue generated by the pizza shop is calculated using the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue 
FROM PizzaSales;
```

#### Average Order Value

The average order value, which represents the average revenue per order, is calculated as:

```sql
SELECT SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Average_Order_Value 
FROM PizzaSales;
```

#### Total Pizzas Sold

The total number of pizzas sold is determined using:

```sql
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS TotalPizza_Sold 
FROM PizzaSales;
```

#### Total Orders

The total number of unique orders is found with:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders 
FROM PizzaSales;
```

#### Average Pizzas per Order

The average number of pizzas per order is calculated as:

```sql
SELECT CAST(CAST(SUM(quantity) AS DECIMAL(10,2))/CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS AvgPizzasPer_Order 
FROM PizzaSales;
```

#### Hourly Trend for Total Pizzas Sold

To understand the trend of pizza sales throughout the day, the following query is used:

```sql'
SELECT DATEPART(hour, order_time) AS Order_hour, SUM(quantity) AS TotalPizza_Sold 
FROM PizzaSales 
GROUP BY DATEPART(hour, order_time) 
ORDER BY DATEPART(hour, order_time);
```

#### Weekly Trend for Total Orders

The weekly trend in total orders is analyzed using:

```sql
SELECT DATEPART(iso_week, order_date) AS week_number, YEAR(order_date) AS Order_year, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders 
FROM PizzaSales 
GROUP BY DATEPART(iso_week, order_date), YEAR(order_date) 
ORDER BY DATEPART(iso_week, order_date), YEAR(order_date);
```

#### Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category

The percentage of total sales by pizza category is calculated as:

```sql
SELECT pizza_category, SUM(total_price) AS Total_Sales, SUM(total_price)*100/(SELECT SUM(total_price) FROM PizzaSales WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 1) AS PercentTotal_Sales 
FROM PizzaSales 
WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 1 
GROUP BY pizza_category;
```

#### Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size

The percentage of sales by pizza size is determined using:

```sql
SELECT pizza_size, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Total_Sales, CAST(SUM(total_price)*100/(SELECT SUM(total_price) FROM PizzaSales WHERE DATEPART(quarter, order_date)=1) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PercentTotal_Sales 
FROM PizzaSales 
WHERE DATEPART(quarter, order_date)=1 
GROUP BY pizza_size 
ORDER BY PercentTotal_Sales DESC;
```

#### Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue

The top 5 best-selling pizzas by revenue are identified with:

```sql
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS total_revenue 
FROM PizzaSales 
GROUP BY pizza_name 
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

#### Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Revenue

Similarly, the bottom 5 pizzas by revenue are found using:

```sql
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS total_revenue 
FROM PizzaSales 
GROUP BY pizza_name 
ORDER BY total_revenue ASC;
```

### Insights

- The total revenue generated is a crucial metric that reflects the overall sales performance.
- Understanding the average order value helps in assessing the revenue generated per transaction.
- Identifying trends in pizza orders at different times and days can assist in optimizing staffing and inventory.
- Analyzing the performance of different pizza categories and sizes can inform decisions on menu offerings.
- Recognizing the top and bottom sellers helps in making strategic decisions related to promotions and product discontinuation.

### Conclusion

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the pizza sales data, highlighting key metrics and trends that can drive informed decision-making. By understanding customer preferences and sales patterns, the pizza shop can optimize its operations and increase profitability.
